* test python 3.11 + gdsfactory
unit tests seem ok, may need some reference GDS files to pass all of them

* deps + dev UX
- `pip install gdsfactory[full,dev]`
- download https://gdsfactory.github.io/skywater130/ (sky130 package) but make sure to use laatest version of gdsfactory, run `make install`

* goal: implement NAND2Tetris chips
** connect two NAND gates and form a NOT
** form an AND
** form an ALU
* goal: print these chips with Google Skywater / Efabless MPW shuttle?
